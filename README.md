## ALIgNment-freE method for long-read vARiants resolution 
Structural variants (SVs) pipelines commonly rely on the alignment.
However, rigid static gap model in alignment is inflexible to resolve diverse SVs and inefficient to compute.
Thus we develop the alignment-free method for more efficient dection of SVs in 3rd sequencing reads.
The results can be called directly by alignment based tools such as the SVs caller PBSV and the visualization tool IGV.

## Build and usage 💩
Linear is easy to build and use.
Make sure the following tools or libraries are available before building the source.
|Prerequisites|Versions|
| ------------------- | ------------------------- |
|<img src="images/linux_logo.png" width="16"/> Linux| >4.9.0|
|<img src="images/gcc_logo.png" width="16"/> GCC|>4.9|
|<img src="images/cmake_logo.png" width="16"/> CMAKE|>3.0.0|
|<img src="images/Zlib_3D_green.svg" width="16"/> zlib|/|


To build from the source create a new directory. In the directory type:
```bash
$CMake [path to source] 
$make linear -j 8 
```
Note:The <b>'-j 8'</b> option is to set up 8 threads to speedup the compilation
### Usage
Supported file formats  for input: .fa(.gz) and .fastq(.gz).
```bash
$linear read.fa genome.fa
``` 
Please add argument <b>'-x'</b> if computing more than one reads and genomes.
```bash
$linear *fa x *fa
``` 
Use -h for more details of options
```bash
$linear -h
```

## Format of files 
Output of Linear extends standard SAM/BAM format to alignment-free results.
Definitions of each fields are extended to adapt to the alignment-free results.
Theses changes include:
### SAM/BAM

|   2  | FLAG  | bitwise FLAG                              | Yes       |

- The 6th column of cigar is changed in the extended SAM/BAM.
Alignment cigar denotes each base, while alignment-free cigar denotes virtual alignment between 2 points.
Specially, alignment-free cigar in Linear is in the format of 'MG', where 'M' is allowed to be 'X' and '=' of standard cigar while 'G' is allowed to be 'I' and 'D' of standard cigar.
An example of virtual alignment of '200=80D' between 2 vertexes is shown in the following figure.
The green region is the estimated region, where the real alignment is supposed to be.

- The 10th column of SEQ is inferred according to the reference and the 4,6th column rather than segment of read.
For cigar operation '=', the corresponding base from the reference rather than the read is inserted into the SEQ.
Thus the operation of '=' in alignment-free result doesn't necessarily mean the read is identical to the reference at the level of base pairs.
This is different from the SEQ for alignment.
The following table lists bases in SEQ from read or reference for each cigar operation, where
1/0 are Yes/No and 0.5 is conditional Yes

|From|=|X|M|I|D|S|H|
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|read|0|0.5|0|1|0|1|0|
|ref|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|

- The 12th column, in which the definition of 'SA:Z' is changed because of the change of 6th and 10th columns.
Other tags are identical to the standard.
Standard definition of the tag can be found at [SAM/BAM format](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf) and [Optional tags](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMtags.pdf)

### Approximate mapping file (.apf)
This is a nonstandard format to provide readable overview of the alignment-free result.
The file can be enabled/disabled with the option '<b>-ot</b>'.
The .apf file contains the header and records
The following are the definition of the header and record.
### header
|col |filed|Description|Type|
|--|--|--|--|
|1|@|sign of header|{'@'}|
|2| QNAME|Query template NAME|string|
|3| QLEN|Query template LENGTH|int|
|4| QSTR|Query template mapped START| int |
|5| QEND|Query template mapped END| int |
|5| QSTRD|Query template mapped main STRAND|{'+','-'}|
|6| RNAME | Reference sequence NAME|String| 
|6| RLEN | Reference sequence LENGTH|int| 
|7| RSTR | Reference sequence mapped START|int| 
|8| REND | Reference sequence mapped END|int| 
### record
|col |filed|Description|Type|
|--|--|--|--|
|1|\||sign to start record|string|
|2|QSTR|Query region start|int|
|3|RSTR|Reference region start|int|
|4|DY|Distance of current 3th col to last|int|
|5|DX|Distance of current 4th col to last|int|
|6|RSTRD|region strand|{'+','-'}|

Following is an example of the apf the read mapped to the reference.

## Adaption to existing pipelines 
The alignment-free results can be called by existing alignment based pipelines.

### Adaption to Samtools
The compatibility of alignment results to Samtools 1.10 has been test.
Alignment-free results can work with samtools view, samtools index and samtools sort and convert the SAM to BAM file.

### Adaption to SVs callers
The compatibility of the alignment-free results to the SVs caller [PBSV](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/pbsv) 2.6.2 has been tested with PacBio raw reads and CCS reads.
SAM/BAM from Linear can work with pbsv discover and pbsv call provided the sample and group name is set appropriately with the -s option in pbsv discover.

### Adaption to seqeunce graphical tools (IGV)
The compatibility of the alignment-free results to the IGV 2.8.3 has been tested.
Alignment-free .bam  can be visualised directly in IGV.

## Updating variant models 🐢
Alignment-free model for variants is  flexible to replace.
Thus we will update models in Linear continuously if there are better ones, such as new models for nested variants.
This probably leads to different results between versions.
